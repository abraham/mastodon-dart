[**getSearchV2**](SearchApi.md#getsearchv2) | **GET** /api/v2/search | Perform a search


# **getSearchV2**
> Search getSearchV2(q, accountId, excludeUnreviewed, following, limit, maxId, minId, offset, resolve, type)

Perform a search

Perform a search for content in accounts, statuses and hashtags with the given parameters.

### Example
```dart
import 'package:mastodon/api.dart';
// TODO Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: OAuth2
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<OAuth>('OAuth2').accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN';

final api = Mastodon().getSearchApi();
final String q = q_example; // String | The search query.
final String accountId = accountId_example; // String | If provided, will only return statuses authored by this account.
final bool excludeUnreviewed = true; // bool | Filter out unreviewed tags? Defaults to false. Use true when trying to find trending tags.
final bool following = true; // bool | Only include accounts that the user is following? Defaults to false.
final int limit = 56; // int | Maximum number of results to return, per type. Defaults to 20 results per category. Max 40 results per category.
final String maxId = maxId_example; // String | All results returned will be lesser than this ID. In effect, sets an upper bound on results.
final String minId = minId_example; // String | Returns results immediately newer than this ID. In effect, sets a cursor at this ID and paginates forward.
final int offset = 56; // int | Skip the first n results.
final bool resolve = true; // bool | Only relevant if `type` includes `accounts` or if `query` is a HTTPS URL. In the first case, if `true` and (a) the search query is for a remote account (e.g., `someaccount@someother.server`) and (b) the local server does not know about the account, [WebFinger] is used to try and resolve the account at `someother.server`. This provides the best recall at higher latency. If `false`, only accounts the server knows about are returned. In the second case, if `true`, resolving the URL and returning the matching status is attempted. If `false`, this resolving logic is circumvented and a regular search is performed instead.
final String type = type_example; // String | Specify whether to search for only `accounts`, `hashtags`, `statuses`

try {
    final response = api.getSearchV2(q, accountId, excludeUnreviewed, following, limit, maxId, minId, offset, resolve, type);
    print(response);
} catch on DioException (e) {
    print('Exception when calling SearchApi->getSearchV2: $e\n');
}
```
